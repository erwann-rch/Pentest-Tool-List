# Useful Methods

1) Explore Colour/Bit Planes & Extract LSB Data
> Images can be hidden inside of the colour/bit planes. Upload your image to [StegOnline](https://stegonline.georgeom.net/). On the image menu page, explore all options in the top panel (i.e. Full Red, Inverse, LSB etc).
>
> Go to "Browse Bit Planes", and browse through all available planes.
>
> If there appears to be some static at the top of any planes, try extracting the data from them in the "Extract Files/Data" menu.

2) Check RGB Values
> ASCII Characters/other data can be hidden in the RGB(A) values of an image.
> 
> Upload your image to [StegOnline](https://stegonline.georgeom.net/), and preview the RGBA values. Try converting them to text, and see if any flag is found. It might be worth looking at just the R/G/B/A values on their own.


3) Found a password?
> If you've found a password, the goto application to check should be steghide (usable without password too).

```bash
steghide extract -sf filename.png
```

4) Browse Colour Palette
> If the PNG is in [type 3 for type specs](https://www.w3.org/TR/PNG-Chunks.html), you should look through the colour palette.
> This site has a feature for randomizing the colour palette, which may reveal the flag. You can also browse through each colour in the palette, if the flag is the same colour.
> It may also be worth looking at the palette indexes themselves, as a string may be visible from there.
